Education
======
* Ph.D., Materials Chemistry, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR (2017 – 2022) 
	* Advisor: Dr. May Nyman 
	* Dissertation focus: Metal-oxo cluster chemistry of actinides (Th, U) and Ce; synthesis and structural characterization of polyoxometalate complexes.
* B.S., Chemistry, Fordham University, Bronx, NY (2014 – 2017)

Research Experience
======
* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) – Postdoctoral Researcher & XRD Facility Manager (2022–Present)
	* Advisors: Dr. Gauthier Deblonde & Dr. Tyler Fears
	* Pioneered micro-scale synthesis of lanthanide and transplutonium polyoxometalate complexes, enabling first structural characterization of curium–POM compounds at the microgram scale (Nature Chemistry, ChemComm).
	* Developed synthetic strategies to modulate optical and spectroscopic properties of f-element complexes, revealing coordination trends between lanthanides and actinides (JACS Au).
	* Fabricated multi-component metallic aerogels (Ag, Au) via novel routes, enhancing structural stability and catalytic activity.
	* Managed and optimized three X-ray diffraction instruments (Rigaku SCXRD, Bruker D8, D2 Phaser) supporting 20+ research groups annually; led safety oversight, user training, and scheduling.
	* Solved and refined 100+ crystal structures in support of multi-lab, multi-disciplinary projects.
* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory – DOE SCGSR and GEM Fellow (Feb–Aug 2021)
	* Advisor: Dr. Gauthier Deblonde
	* Designed and implemented synthetic and spectroscopic methods for transplutonium–POM complexes, culminating in the isolation of novel curium coordination compounds (Nature Chemistry)
* Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR – Graduate Research Assistant (Jan 2018 – March 2022)
	* Advisor: Dr. May Nyman
	* Expanded aqueous actinide chemistry (Th, U, Ce) through controlled cation-mediated synthesis, isolating clusters from 1–70 metal centers and advancing understanding of metal–oxo assembly.
	* Synthesized and functionalized tungsten polyoxometalates with organotin ligands to enhance actinide binding and tune solubility.
	* Applied SCXRD, SAXS, and multinuclear NMR to establish structure–property relationships, contributing to 10+ peer-reviewed publications.
* Fordham University, Bronx, NY – Undergraduate Research Assistant (Jan 2016 – June 2017)
	* Advisor: Prof. Christopher Koenigsmann
	* Investigated bi-metallic nanowire synthesis for electrochemical glucose sensing, optimizing core–shell fabrication and electrochemical performance.
