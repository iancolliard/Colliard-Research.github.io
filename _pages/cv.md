Education
======
* Ph.D., Materials Chemistry, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR (2017 – 2022) 
Advisor: Dr. May Nyman; Dissertation focus: Metal-oxo cluster chemistry of actinides (Th, U) and Ce; synthesis and structural characterization of polyoxometalate complexes.
* B.S., Chemistry, Fordham University, Bronx, NY (2014 – 2017)

Research Experience
======
* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) – Postdoctoral Researcher & XRD Facility Manager (2022–Present)
Advisors: Dr. Gauthier Deblonde & Dr. Tyler Fears
	* Pioneered micro-scale synthesis of lanthanide and transplutonium polyoxometalate complexes, enabling first structural characterization of curium–POM compounds at the microgram scale (Nature Chemistry, ChemComm).
	* Developed synthetic strategies to modulate optical and spectroscopic properties of f-element complexes, revealing coordination trends between lanthanides and actinides (JACS Au).
	* Fabricated multi-component metallic aerogels (Ag, Au) via novel routes, enhancing structural stability and catalytic activity.
	* Managed and optimized three X-ray diffraction instruments (Rigaku SCXRD, Bruker D8, D2 Phaser) supporting 20+ research groups annually; led safety oversight, user training, and scheduling.
	* Solved and refined 100+ crystal structures in support of multi-lab, multi-disciplinary projects.
* Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory – DOE SCGSR and GEM Fellow (Feb–Aug 2021)
Advisor: Dr. Gauthier Deblonde
•Designed and implemented synthetic and spectroscopic methods for transplutonium–POM complexes, culminating in the isolation of novel curium coordination compounds (Nature Chemistry)
* Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR – Graduate Research Assistant (Jan 2018 – March 2022)
Advisor: Dr. May Nyman
•Expanded aqueous actinide chemistry (Th, U, Ce) through controlled cation-mediated synthesis, isolating clusters from 1–70 metal centers and advancing understanding of metal–oxo assembly.
•Synthesized and functionalized tungsten polyoxometalates with organotin ligands to enhance actinide binding and tune solubility.
•Applied SCXRD, SAXS, and multinuclear NMR to establish structure–property relationships, contributing to 10+ peer-reviewed publications.
* Fordham University, Bronx, NY – Undergraduate Research Assistant (Jan 2016 – June 2017)
Advisor: Prof. Christopher Koenigsmann
•Investigated bi-metallic nanowire synthesis for electrochemical glucose sensing, optimizing core–shell fabrication and electrochemical performance.
