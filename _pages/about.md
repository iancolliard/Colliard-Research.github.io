I’m Ian Colliard, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I study the chemistry of polyoxometalate (POM) complexes of lanthanides and actinides. My research integrates crystallography, spectroscopy, and data-driven analysis to uncover how structure controls luminescence and photophysical behavior, with the broader goal of advancing new materials for photonics and quantum technologies.

My path in science began early, I developed a fascination with chemistry at the age of ten, graduated from high school in Florida, and moved to New York City at sixteen to begin my bachelor’s degree. By nineteen I had completed my undergraduate studies, and by twenty-three I had earned my Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry. This accelerated academic trajectory reflects both my dedication to research and my ability to thrive in challenging, fast-paced environments.

Since then, I have published over 170 crystal structures and multiple high-impact papers, building a portfolio that connects fundamental chemistry with cutting-edge applications. I am equally passionate about mentoring students, fostering inclusive scientific communities, and creating bridges between disciplines. Beyond the lab, I enjoy projects that blend science and creativity, from 3D-printing molecular models to designing research-inspired artwork.
