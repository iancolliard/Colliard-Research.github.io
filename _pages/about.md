I’m Ian Colliard, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I explore the frontier of inorganic and actinide chemistry. My work focuses on polyoxometalate (POM) complexes of lanthanides and actinides, with a special emphasis on their luminescence, photophysics, and structural chemistry. By combining advanced crystallography, spectroscopy, and data-driven analysis, I aim to uncover how subtle structural changes influence optical properties—paving the way for next-generation photonic and quantum materials.

I earned my doctorate early in my career and have since built a portfolio of over 170 published crystal structures and multiple high-impact papers. My research vision integrates fundamental chemistry with applications spanning energy, materials design, and quantum information science.

Beyond the lab, I’m passionate about mentoring the next generation of scientists, promoting inclusion in STEM, and sharing science through outreach and teaching. I also enjoy creative projects that bridge art and science—whether that’s 3D-printing molecular models, designing research-inspired tattoos, or curating my digital research gallery.
