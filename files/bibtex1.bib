   abstract = {Since the earliest reports in the late 2000s, the development of one-dimensional (1D) electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has undergone profound growth, both in terms of the breadth of structures developed, and in terms of the achievable activity and durability. In this chapter, we review the recent developments that have taken place over the last 5 years in this rapidly growing field. Specifically, we focus on exploring the fundamental structure-function relationships, including the effect of catalyst dimensions, composition, and surface structure on the corresponding catalytic activity and durability. We also examine the recent and growing implementation of combinatorial methods that merge catalyst design with in situ spectroscopic techniques and computational methods to develop new approaches to understanding the correlation between catalyst structure and activity. Starting with Pt-based systems, we discuss the recent insights into the size- and structure-dependent catalytic properties of 1D structures and explore the mechanism of degradation of 1D nanostructures under the operating conditions of fuel cell devices. Subsequently, we consider the emergent ability to precisely tune the three-dimensional structure and composition of Pt-based alloy and hierarchical structures, which has allowed for an unprecedented ability to engineer the electronic and structural properties of the catalysts. Finally, we explore how the advances in the development of Pt-based systems have enabled a transition toward catalysts composed of transition metals that are considerably less expensive and more abundant than Pt, yet maintain similar or even better activities than Pt.},

   abstract = {The synthesis and study of radioactive compounds are both inherently limited by their toxicity, cost and isotope scarcity. Traditional methods using small inorganic or organic complexes typically require milligrams of sample—per attempt—which for some isotopes is equivalent to the world’s annual supply. Here we demonstrate that polyoxometalates (POMs) enable the facile formation, crystallization, handling and detailed characterization of metal–ligand complexes from microgram quantities owing to their high molecular weight and controllable solubility properties. Three curium–POM complexes were prepared, using just 1–10 μg per synthesis of the rare isotope 248Cm3+, and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, showing an eight-coordinated Cm3+ centre. Moreover, spectrophotometric, fluorescence, NMR and Raman analyses of several f-block element–POM complexes, including 243Am3+ and 248Cm3+, showed otherwise unnoticeable differences between their solution versus solid-state chemistry, and actinide versus lanthanide behaviour. This POM-driven strategy represents a viable path to isolate even rarer complexes, notably with actinium or transcalifornium elements. The study of rare isotopes is hampered by their scarcity, cost and sometimes toxicity. Now polyoxometalate ligands have been shown to facilitate the capture of f-block elements and their characterization. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures have been obtained for several molecular complexes, including three of the rare curium-248, from minute amounts (micrograms) of material.},

Ce70 crystallizes into intricate high pore volume frameworks with divalent transition metals and Ce-monomer linkers. Eight crystal-structures feature four framework types in which the Ce70-rings are linked as propellers, in offset-stacks, in a tartan pattern, and as isolated rings. Small-angle X-ray scattering of Ce70 dissolved in butylamine, with and without added cations (CeIV, alkaline earths, MnII), shows the metals‘ differentiating roles in ring linking, leading to supramolecular assemblies. The large acidic pores and abundant terminal sulfates provide ion-exchange behavior, demonstrated with UIV and NdIII. Frameworks featuring CeIII/IV-monomer linkers demonstrate both oxidation and reduction. This study opens the door to mixed-metal, highly porous framework catalysts, and new clusters for metal-organic framework design.},

Herein, we explore the mechanism of multi-electron redox processes that allow the highly reduced POM clusters of the form \{MO3\}yto absorb y electrons in aqueous solution, focusing mechanistically on the Wells-Dawson structure X6[P2W18O62], which comprises 18 metal centers and can uptake up to 18 electrons reversibly (y = 18) per cluster in aqueous solution when the countercations are lithium. This unconventional redox activity is rationalized by density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulations, UV-vis, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering spectra. These data point to a new phenomenon showing that cluster protonation and aggregation allow the formation of highly electron-rich meta-stable systems in aqueous solution, which produce H2when the solution is diluted. Finally, we show that this understanding is transferrable to other salts of [P5W30O110]15-and [P8W48O184]40-anions, which can be charged to 23 and 27 electrons per cluster, respectively.},

   abstract = {Heterometallic CeIV/M oxo clusters are underexplored yet and can benefit from synergistic properties from combining cerium and other metal cations to produce efficient redox catalysts. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of new Ce12V6 oxo clusters with different capping ligands: Ce12V6-SO4, Ce12V6-OTs (OTs: toluenesulfonic acid), and Ce12V6-NBSA (NBSA: nitrobenzenesulfonic acid). Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) for all three structures reveals a Ce12V6 cubane core formulated [Ce12(VO)6O24]18+ with cerium on the edges of the cube, vanadyl capping the faces, and sulfate on the corners. While infrared spectroscopy (IR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) proved the successful coordination of the organic ligands to the Ce12V6 core, liquid phase 51V NMR and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) confirmed the integrity of the clusters in the organic solutions. Furthermore, functionalization of the Ce12V6 core with organic ligands both provides increased solubility in term of homogeneous application and introduces porosity to the assemblies of Ce12V6-OTs and Ce12V6-NBSA in term of heterogeneous application, thus allowing more catalytic sites to be accessible and improving reactivity as compared to the nonporous and less soluble Ce12V6-SO4. Meanwhile, the coordinated ligands also influenced the electronic environment of the catalytic sites, in turn affecting the reactivity of the cluster, which we probed by the selective oxidation of 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). This work provides a strategy to make full use of the catalytic sites within a class of inorganic sulfate capped clusters via organic ligand introduction.},

We investigated the activity of the MCe70 torus family (M = Cd, Ce, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Zn), a family of discrete oxysulfate-based Ce70 rings linked by monomeric cation units, for CO oxidation. CuCe70 emerged as the best performing MCe70 catalyst among those tested, prompting our exploration of the role of the interfacial unit on catalytic activity. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies of the catalysts indicated a lower temperature reduction in CuCe70 as compared to CeCe70. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) indicated that CuCe70 exhibited a faster formation of Ce3+ and contained CO bridging sites absent in CeCe70. Isothermal CO adsorption measurements demonstrated a greater uptake of CO by CuCe70 as compared to CeCe70. The calculated energies for the formation of a single oxygen defect in the structure significantly decreased with the presence of Cu at the linkage site as opposed to Ce. This study revealed that atomic-level changes in the interfacial unit can change the reducibility, CO binding/uptake, and oxygen vacancy defect formation energetics in the MCe70 family to thus tune their catalytic activity.},

While many reports have focused on actinide complexation by relatively simple monocarboxylates such as amino acids, in this work we examined Th(IV) and U(IV) complexation by 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in water with the aim of understanding the impact that the organic backbone has on the solution and solid state structural chemistry of thorium(IV) and uranium(IV) complexes. Two compounds of the general formula [An6O4(OH)4(H2O)6(4-HB)12]·nH2O [An = Th (Th-1) and U (U-1); 4-HB = 4-hydroxybenzoate] were synthesized via room-temperature reactions of AnCl4 and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in water. Solid state structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and the compounds were further characterized by Raman, infrared, and optical spectroscopies and thermogravimetry. The magnetism of U-1 was also examined. The structures of the Th and U compounds are isomorphous and are built from ligand-decorated oxo/hydroxo-bridged hexanuclear units. The relationship between the building units observed in the solid state structure of U-1 and those that exist in solution prior to crystallization as well as upon dissolution of U-1 in nonaqueous solvents was investigated using small-angle X-ray scattering, ultraviolet-visible optical spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The evolution of U solution speciation as a function of reaction time and temperature was examined. Such effects as well as the impact of the ligand on the formation and evolution of hexanuclear U(IV) clusters to UO2 nanoparticles compared to prior reported monocarboxylate ligand systems are discussed. Unlike prior reported syntheses of Th and U(IV) hexamers where the pH was adjusted to ∼2 and 3, respectively, to drive hydrolysis, hexamer formation with the HB ligand appears to be promoted only by the ligand.},

Density functional theory calculations were performed to predict the respective vibrational frequencies of the structural units, and their relative stability was predicted at the correlated molecular theory level. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis of [Th3(OH)5]7+ in water indicates that the trimeric structural unit remains intact and that it is indeed an important species that necessitates consideration in geochemical models and for design of Th materials from water.},

Solution-phase behavior, based on POM-QAC interactions, was similar for all formulations in polar and nonpolar organic solvents, as observed by X-ray scattering and multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. However, solid thin films of the butyltin-functionalized hybrid POM salts were significantly more stable and adhesive than their inorganic analogues. We attribute this to the favorable hydrophobic interactions between the butyltin groups and the QACs. All synthesized hybrid POM salts display a potent antimicrobial activity toward Escherichia coli. These studies provide fundamental form-function understanding of hybrid POM salts, based on interactions between ions in these complex hybrid phases.},

   abstract = {Deciphering the solution chemistry and speciation of actinides is inherently difficult due to radioactivity, rarity, and cost constraints, especially for transplutonium elements. In this context, the development of new chelating platforms for actinides and associated spectroscopic techniques is particularly important. In this study, we investigate a relatively overlooked class of chelators for actinide binding, namely, polyoxometalates (POMs). We provide the first NMR measurements on americium-POM and curium-POM complexes, using one-dimensional (1D) 31P NMR, variable-temperature NMR, and spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) experiments. The proposed POM-NMR approach allows for the study of trivalent f-elements even when only microgram amounts are available and in phosphate-containing solutions where f-elements are typically insoluble. The solution-state speciation of trivalent americium, curium, plus multiple lanthanide ions (La3+, Nd3+, Sm3+, Eu3+, Yb3+, and Lu3+), in the presence of the model POM ligand PW11O397- was elucidated and revealed the concurrent formation of two stable complexes, [MIII(PW11O39)(H2O)x]4- and [MIII(PW11O39)2]11-. Interconversion reaction constants, reaction enthalpies, and reaction entropies were derived from the NMR data. The NMR results also provide experimental evidence of the weakly paramagnetic nature of the Am3+ and Cm3+ ions in solution. Furthermore, the study reveals a previously unnoticed periodicity break along the f-element series with the reversal of T1 relaxation times of the 1:1 and 1:2 complexes and the preferential formation of the long T1 species for the early lanthanides versus the short T1 species for the late lanthanides, americium, and curium. Given the broad variety of POM ligands that exist, with many of them containing NMR-active nuclei, the combined POM-NMR approach reported here opens a new avenue to investigate difficult-to-study elements such as heavy actinides and other radionuclides.},

Recently, their solid-state characterization reveals polymerization of the metal-DNA helices, leading to a one-dimensional Ag-DNA array. Here, we investigate the potential of polyoxometalates (POMs) to connect and join metal-DNA complexes to disrupt polymerization and control the dimensionality and nuclearity of Ag chains and clusters. We have used [Ag(mcytosine)2]+complexes (mcytosine = 1-methyl-cytosine) as inexpensive and well-known models for metal-DNA complexes, to assemble and structurally characterize (via single-crystal X-ray diffraction) five Ag-mcytosine-POM lattices: (1) three featuring the [CrMo6(OH)6O18]3-Anderson POM, (2) one with decavanadate, and (3) one with decaniobate ([M10O28]6-M = V or Nb). Both covalent and noncovalent interactions drive the crystallization of the observed Ag-mcytosine-POM assemblies, including the targeted Ag-POM bonding. Noncovalent associations include π-πinteractions of Ag-bound and unbound mcytosine ligands, Ag-Ag argentophilic interactions, and H-bonding between POMs and mcytosine. These structures reveal that we can influence the [Ag+]nnuclearity by the charge and protonation state of the POM, while the basicity of the POM influences Ag-POM bonding. In addition, we isolate an unprecedented binuclear silver-mediated cytosine pair adopting a Watson-Crick conformation.},

   abstract = {Conspectus Polyoxometalates (POMs, metals = V4/5+, Nb5+, Ta5+, Mo5/6+, and W5/6+) can be described as molecular metal oxides. The V, Mo, and W-POMs (classic POMs) exhibit rich structural diversity with interesting redox properties, acid catalysis, inorganic ligands, and colorimetric properties and behavior. Nb and Ta POMs, while structurally similar, are generally stable only in base and redox behavior is rare, and they are synthetically far less accessible. The V, Mo, and W-POMs have been studied for well over a century, Nb-POM chemistry has emerged in the last 20 years, and Ta-POM chemistry is yet to see consistent and significant advances. Early and current success in Nb-POM chemistry is owed mainly to hydrothermal synthesis, which is wholly unsatisfying, given the black box nature of this technique. For the last 5 years and as summarized in this Account, we have exploited decaniobate, [Nb10O28]6- (Nb10), as a foundation to perform room-temperature, nearly pH-neutral manipulations of Nb-POM solutions. Nb10, with a rare neutral self-buffering pH, responds to any interactions with electrolytes (specifically oxoanions and metal cations) by undergoing transformations, leading to new topologies. The ease of Nb10 transformation yielding new generations of Nb-POMs, akin to an inorganic analogue of biological model organisms such as the fruit fly, inspired the title of this Account. The common building unit born from the disassembly of Nb10 is [Nb7O20(OH, H2O)2](5-7)-, and the hydroxyl/aqua ligands provide reactivity for linking via condensation reactions, ligand exchange, heterometals, or oxoanions. We can coax these newly assembled Nb-POMs (detected by small-angle X-ray scattering, SAXS) to crystallize via the usual methods of vapor diffusion, salting out, and reduced temperature, and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures are valuable for understanding reaction mechanisms to fine-tune control and yield a landscape of topologies and compositions. Beyond providing an opportunity to comprehend and diversify POM chemistry, the reactivity of Nb10 yields highly soluble (i.e., >2 M Nb), nearly neutral aqueous solutions of niobium, ideal for the solution-phase deposition of thin films, demonstrated with LiNbO3, (Na,K)NbO3, Nb2O5, and heterometal-doped Nb2O5. The obtained films are cohesive and smooth, enabled by the tendency of these solutions to gel if simply evaporated quickly. Per our current endeavors, this gelation behavior provides an opportunity to develop new soft, flexible materials including inorganic networks, organic-inorganic networks, and porous solids and explore their material properties including base catalysis and sorption (i.e., CO2). Nb-POM (and Ta-POM) discovery and implementation of properties is far from complete. While heterometal (d and f element) substitution is easy with classic POMs, imparting a whole host of functions (tuned luminescence, catalysis, electroactivity, etc.), it remains a challenge with Nb-POMs due to pH incompatibility with most heterometals. This grand challenge that defies fundamental aqueous behavior of metal cations requires the creation of liquid mixtures that include polymer and/or ionic liquid components, and the creation of such reaction media can impact synthesis beyond POM chemistry. The goal of this Account is to describe the recent advances in Nb-POM chemistry, afforded by the Nb10 “fruit fly”, and to also provide insight into the next large steps needed to advance Nb-POM chemistry.},

We elucidated assembly mechanisms by the X-ray scattering (small-angle scattering and total scattering) of solutions and solids as well as crystallizing and identifying fragments of Ce70 by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Fragments show evidence for templated growth (Ce5, [Ce5(O)3(SO4)12]10-) and modular assembly from hexamer (Ce6) building units (Ce13, [Ce13(OH)6(O)12(SO4)14(H2O)14]6- and Ce62, [Ce62(OH)30(O)58(SO4)58]14-). Ce62, an almost complete ring, precipitates instantaneously in the presence of ammonium cations as two torqued arcs that interlock by hydrogen boding through NH4+, a structural motif not observed before in inorganic systems. The room temperature rapid assemblies of both Ce70 and Ce62, respectively, by the addition of Li+ and NH4+, along with ion-exchange and redox behavior, invite exploitation of this emerging material family in environmental and energy applications.},

Hierarchical assembly of superatoms gives rise to emergent properties in lattices of quantum dots, p-block clusters, and fullerenes. Here, we introduce a family of uranium-oxysulfate cluster anions whose hierarchical assembly in water is controlled by two parameters: acidity and the lanthanide or transition-metal countercation. In acid, larger LnIII (Ln = La-Ho) link hexamer (U6) oxoclusters into body-centered cubic frameworks, while smaller LnIII (Ln = Er-Lu and Y) promote linking of 14 U6 clusters into hollow superclusters (U84 superatoms). U84 assembles into superlattices including cubic-closest packed, body-centered cubic, and interpenetrating networks, bridged by interstitial countercations and U6 clusters. Divalent transition metals (TM = MnII and ZnII) charge-balance and promote the fusion of 10 U6 and 10 U monomers into a wheel-shaped cluster (U70). Dissolution of U70 in organic media reveals (by small-angle X-ray scattering) that differing supramolecular assemblies are accessed, controlled by TMII-linking of U70 clusters. Magnetic measurements of these assemblies reveal Curie-Weiss behavior at high temperatures, without pairing of the 5f2-electrons down to 2 K.},

Herein, we present new metal/ligand systems covering a wide range of ionic radii, charges, and elements. Five different ligands derived from the Keggin structure (HBW11O398-, PW11O397-, SiW11O398-, GeW11O398-, and GaW11O399-) were successfully crystallized with six different cations (Na+, Sr2+, Ba2+, La3+, Ce4+, and Th4+) and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Twenty-five new compounds were obtained by using Cs+ as the counterion, yielding a consistent base formula of Csx[M(XW11O39)2]·nH2O. Despite having a similar first-coordination sphere geometry (i.e., 8-coordinated), the nature of the central cation was found to impact the long-range geometry of the complexes. This unique crystallographic data set shows that, despite the traditional consensus, the local geometry of the cation (i.e., metal-oxygen bond distance) is not enough to depict the full impact of the complexed metal ion. The bending and twisting of the complexes, as well as ligand-ligand distances, were all impacted by the nature of the central cation. We also observed that counterions play a critical role by stabilizing the geometry of the M(XW11)2 complex and directing complex-complex interactions in the lattice. We also define certain structural limits for this type of complex, with the large Ba2+ ion seemingly approaching those limits. This study thus lays the foundation for capturing the coordination chemistry of other rarer elements across the periodic table such as Ra2+, Ac3+, Bk4+, Cf3+, etc.},

Similarities between these tetravalent metals are particularly illuminated in their hydrolysis and condensation behavior in aqueous systems, leading to polynuclear clusters typified by the hexamer [MIV6O4(OH)4]12+ building block. Prior studies have shown the predominance and coexistence of smaller species for ThIV (monomers, dimers, and hexamers) and larger species for UIV, NpIV, and PuIV (including 38-mers and 70-mers). We show here that aqueous uranium(IV) sulfate also displays behavior similar to that of ThIV (and ZrIV) in its isolated solid-phase and solution speciation. Two single-crystal X-ray structures are described: a dihydroxide-bridged dimer (U2) formulated as U2(OH)2(SO4)3(H2O)4 and a monomer-linked hexamer framework (U-U6) as (U(H2O)3.5)2U6O4(OH)4(SO4)10(H2O)9. These structures are similar to those previously described for ThIV. Moreover, cocrystallization of monomer and dimer and of dimer and monomer-hexamer phases for both ThIV (prior) and UIV (current) indicates the coexistence of these species in solution. Because it was not possible to effectively study the sulfate-rich solutions via X-ray scattering from which U2 and U-U6 crystallized, we provide a parallel solution speciation study in low sulfate conditions, as a function of the pH. Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering of these show decreasing sulfate binding, increased hydrolysis, increased species size, and increased complexity, with increasing pH. This study describes a bridge across the first half the actinide series, highlighting UIV similarities to ThIV, in addition to the previously known similarities to the transuranic elements.},

This first “serial approach” on transplutonium chemistry was allowed by minimizing the amount of f-element needed per synthesis down to ∼10 μg. This offers a unique opportunity to contrast structural and spectroscopic properties of trivalent actinide with those of lanthanide compounds under identical conditions. The results showcase that although actinide(III) and lanthanide(III) can make isostructural complexes, their solid-state coordination chemistries deviate significantly. The curium and americium compounds were found to be more uniform than their europium and neodymium counterparts, respectively. The particular symmetry of the Cm-POMs also enables the observation of rarely seen emission bands, which hints at vibronic coupling or new emissive pathways. Additionally, the Cm-POM and Eu-POM complexes were characterized via steady-state and time-resolved excitation and emission spectroscopy in solutions containing five different counterions (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+), representing 50 combinations of alkali/[MIII(XW11)2]n− complexes. The Cm-POMs respond to the alkali counterions by improving symmetry from Li+ to Cs+, while the Eu-POMs do the opposite. The luminescence lifetimes of the Cm-POMs also depart from the ideal Kimura equation. This study provides a rare, and perhaps the most comprehensive, experimental data set comparing heavy actinides and lanthanides via single crystal XRD plus, solution-state, solid-state, and time-resolved emission spectroscopy and demonstrates that lanthanides are only a coarse approximation for actinide elements.},

   abstract = {Experimental studies involving actinide compounds are inherently limited in scope due to the radioactive nature of these elements and the scarcity and cost of their research isotopes. Now, ∼80 years after the introduction of the actinide concept by Glenn Seaborg, we still only have a limited understanding of the coordination chemistry of f-block metals when compared to more common elements such as the s-, p-, and d-blocks. This is particularly true for transplutonium actinides (Am, Cm, Bk, etc.) whose chemistry is often considered similar to trivalent lanthanides─mainly because of the lack of experimental data. We here report a metal-ligand system for which lanthanide and heavy actinide coordination compounds can be synthesized efficiently (i.e., requiring only a few micrograms) under identical conditions. Seventeen single crystal XRD structures of trivalent f-elements complexed to the polyoxometalate (POM) PW11O397- were obtained, including the full lanthanide series (Cs11Ln(PW11O39)2·nH2O, Ln = La to Lu, except Pm), the equivalent yttrium compound, a curium-POM compound (α2-Cs11Cm(PW11O39)2·33H2O), and the first two Am3+-POM compounds structurally characterized (α1-Cs11Am(PW11O39)2·6H2O and α2-Cs11Am(PW11O39)2·21H2O). Importantly, this represents a unique series of compounds built on the same 1:2 metal:ligand unit and where all the f-elements are 8-coordinated and squared antiprismatic, thus providing a consistent platform for intra- and inter-series comparison. Despite a similar first coordination sphere environment, significant crystallographic and spectroscopic differences were observed among early and late lanthanides, as well as lanthanides and actinides, and even between americium and curium. These results show that even within the same coordination chemistry framework, 4f and 5f elements exhibit fundamental chemical differences that cannot be explained by simple size-match arguments. This study offers a versatile coordination platform to magnify differences within the f-block that have remained difficult to observe with traditional ligand systems.},
