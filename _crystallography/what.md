# What is Crystallography?

Crystallography is the science of determining the arrangement of atoms in solids. Using X-ray diffraction, I can visualize atomic positions and understand bonding, geometry, and electronic structure.  

This page provides context for the crystal structures showcased here, from polyoxometalates to lanthanide and actinide complexes.
